### Boot loader installation

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other

#### Advanced options
### Running custom commands during the installation
# This first command is run as early as possible, just after

# prevent packaged version of VirtualBox Guest Additions is installed
d-i preseed/early_command string sed -i \
  '/in-target/idiscover(){/sbin/discover|grep -v VirtualBox;}' \
  /usr/lib/pre-pkgsel.d/20install-hwpackages

#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb
# This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be
# useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state
# of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs).

#d-i partman/early_command \
#       string debconf-set partman-auto/disk "$(list-devices disk | head -n1)"
# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.

#d-i preseed/late_command string apt-install zsh; in-target chsh -s /bin/zsh
d-i preseed/late_command string \
